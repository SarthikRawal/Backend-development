> bcrypt

The bcrypt module in JavaScript is a popular library for hashing and verifying passwords. It provides robust methods for creating salted password hashes and comparing them, ensuring secure password storage and authentication.

> Features
- Salting: Automatically generates a salt and appends it to the password before hashing.
- Hashing: Uses the Blowfish cipher to create a secure hash of the password.
- Comparison: Verifies if a given plain text password matches a hashed password.
- Adjustable Work Factor: Allows setting the cost factor to control the computational complexity of the hashing process, balancing security and performance.

> installation
