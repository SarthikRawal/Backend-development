> bcrypt

The bcrypt module in JavaScript is a popular library for hashing and verifying passwords. It provides robust methods for creating salted password hashes and comparing them, ensuring secure password storage and authentication.

> Features
- Salting: Automatically generates a salt and appends it to the password before hashing.
- Hashing: Uses the Blowfish cipher to create a secure hash of the password.
- Comparison: Verifies if a given plain text password matches a hashed password.
- Adjustable Work Factor: Allows setting the cost factor to control the computational complexity of the hashing process, balancing security and performance.

> installation

--> npm i bcrypt


> Salting

Salting is a security practice used in password hashing to enhance the protection of passwords against various types of attacks, such as rainbow table attacks and pre-computed hash attacks. When a password is salted, a unique, random value (called a "salt") is generated and added to the password before it is hashed. This makes each password hash unique, even if two users have the same password.

> How Salting Works:

Generate a Salt: A random value is generated.
Combine Salt and Password: The salt is appended or prepended to the password.
Hash the Combination: The combined string (salt + password) is then hashed using a secure hashing algorithm.
Store Salt and Hash: Both the salt and the hashed value are stored in the database.
