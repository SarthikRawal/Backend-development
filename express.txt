> Express.js

- Express.js is a popular open-source web framework for Node.js. It's essentially a tool that simplifies building web applications and APIs on the server-side using JavaScript.

Here are some key things to know about Express.js:

- Focuses on Node.js: It's designed specifically to work with Node.js, leveraging its strengths for asynchronous programming and event-driven architecture.
- Lightweight and Flexible: Express.js is known for its minimalist approach, providing a core set of features that can be easily extended using middleware. This allows for a lot of customization and flexibility in building web applications.
- Routing: A core feature of Express.js is routing, which helps define how the application responds to different URL requests (GET, POST, etc.) and directs them to the appropriate functions.
- APIs: Express.js is great for building RESTful APIs, which are web services that follow a specific set of architectural principles for data exchange.

Overall, Express.js is a powerful tool that can streamline the development process for web applications and APIs on the Node.js platform.


> Getting started with Express.js

1. Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. 

2. Project Setup:
Create a project directory: Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project using mkdir.
Navigate to the directory: Use the cd command to enter the newly created project directory.
Initialize project: Run npm init to initialize a new npm project. This will create a package.json file for managing project dependencies.

3. Install Express:
Use npm to install Express as a dependency for your project. Run the following command in your terminal:

-> npm install express

4. Create your Express App:
Create a file named app.js (or any name you prefer) in your project directory. This file will contain the code for your Express application.

5. Basic Express Server:
Open app.js in your preferred code editor.

        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();

        // Define the port to listen on (usually 3000)
        const port = 3000;

        // Basic route for handling GET requests to the root path ('/')
        app.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Hello World!');
        });

        // Start the server and listen for incoming requests
        app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
        });

6. Run the Server:
In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to start the Express server:

-> node app.js
