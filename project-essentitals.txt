1. package.json

> A file at the root of a Node.js project that acts as a manifest.
Contains essential information about your project, including:
. Name
. Version
. Author
. License
. Dependencies (more on that below)
. Scripts (commands to run specific tasks in your project)
. Created and managed using the npm init command.

2. package-lock.json:

. A file generated by npm to lock down the exact versions of dependencies used in your project.
. Ensures everyone working on the project uses the same versions, preventing unexpected errors due to dependency version changes.
. Don't add this file to your version control system (like Git) by default. Instead, use npm ci for reliable dependency installation across environments.

3. node_modules:

. A folder automatically created by npm when you run npm install.
. Contains all the third-party code (dependencies) your project relies on.
. Don't add this folder to version control either, as it can become quite large.

4. Dependencies:

. Third-party libraries or packages your project needs to function properly in a production environment (when deployed).
. Listed in the dependencies section of your package.json file.
. Installed by running npm install in your project directory.

5. Dev Dependencies:

. Third-party libraries or packages needed for development tasks like testing, building, or linting, but not required for the project to run in production.
. Listed in the devDependencies section of your package.json file.
. Installed by running npm install or, to exclude them from production builds, npm install --save-dev.

6. Nodemon:

. A utility for Node.js development that automatically restarts your Node.js application when you make changes to your code.
. Saves you the hassle of manually restarting the application after every code edit.

7. Babel:

. A JavaScript compiler that can transpile modern JavaScript code (written using features not yet supported by all browsers) into code that can run in older browsers.
. Useful for ensuring your code works across a wider range of browsers.

8. dotenv:

. A library that allows you to load environment variables from a .env file.
. Useful for storing sensitive information (like API keys or database credentials) outside of your code, . improving security.
. Requires installing the dotenv package and calling dotenv.config() in your code to load the environment variables.

9. gitignore:

. A file in your version control system (like Git) that specifies which files and folders should be ignored when committing changes to the repository.
. Helps keep your repository clean and organized by excluding unnecessary files like node_modules or temporary build artifacts.

10. Frameworks vs libraries:

Frameworks: Provide a more comprehensive structure for building web applications, often dictating the overall application architecture and offering a wide range of built-in features. (Examples: Express.js, React, Angular)

Libraries: Offer specific functionality that you can integrate into your existing codebase without enforcing a particular structure. (Examples: Lodash for utility functions, Moment.js for date manipulation)
