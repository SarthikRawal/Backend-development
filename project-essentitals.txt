1. package.json

> A file at the root of a Node.js project that acts as a manifest.
Contains essential information about your project, including:
. Name
. Version
. Author
. License
. Dependencies (more on that below)
. Scripts (commands to run specific tasks in your project)
. Created and managed using the npm init command.

2. package-lock.json:

. A file generated by npm to lock down the exact versions of dependencies used in your project.
. Ensures everyone working on the project uses the same versions, preventing unexpected errors due to dependency version changes.
. Don't add this file to your version control system (like Git) by default. Instead, use npm ci for reliable dependency installation across environments.

3. node_modules:

. A folder automatically created by npm when you run npm install.
. Contains all the third-party code (dependencies) your project relies on.
. Don't add this folder to version control either, as it can become quite large.

4. Dependencies:

. Third-party libraries or packages your project needs to function properly in a production environment (when deployed).
. Listed in the dependencies section of your package.json file.
. Installed by running npm install in your project directory.
